Quick Story:
As I came back to Ecuador after 5 years of living in Phoenix Arizona, I got an aparment near the office where I was starting LatinoAmericaMedia.com, that allowed me to walk from home to the office, every morning. On my way there sometime I will see Anibal, who as you can see in the videos, is a double amputee.
As usual I got intriged about his live, and his story. Turns out we where practically neihbords almos a decade ago. he lived across the street from an old appartment. 
Now he begs for money on the stop lights to make a living. 

As he takes each step you can tell, he is in pain, at least is not easy, becuase his prothesis are, basically two sticks, no knees, no joins, no flexible parts. Just two iron sticks. 

I wanted to help, just didnt know how. We started talking about his prosthetic legs, and what I found out blew my mind.
Those prosthetic legs, are $3000 each, not only that mantaining them is around $500 a year. And to add injury to insult, they are not that great as you can see. 

At that time, I was learning about 3d printing in my free time and was sure that I could make something way better, and cheaper. 
But didnt know what it would take. Here is a little description of that journey. I sharing all the files, designs, etc. 
And there  is a lot of work to do still. 

I put the project a side because I couldnt find a non-expensive knee to add to the probe of concept. I only found 1 company ReMotion, d-rev.org.
I would call and email but never got an answer. I even sent a message through linked in to a founder... nothing. 
Until 2 weeks ago (Jul 21, 2017) I finally got an answer. They mentioned that they where planning to get the knees in production on the next couple of week. Wish me luck.
